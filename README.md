### Things about me

I enjoy coding/programming, and i enjoy skating as well.

My first language was html & a hint of css.
about 4 months later i got into minecraft & (still kind of am-ish) so i decided to try to learn java
never got very good but i understand it, after that i decided to learn python which I enjoy and love.
i started to learn javascript/svelte which im not very good at but its fun

As of writing this im about to go make a client to try to learn more java so wish me luck. (that client was remainder and surprisingly turned out to be extremely successful)
